# PreToolUse guard for the scoped-peer path.
#
# It enforces exactly one rule: the main agent may not call
# `mcp__escapement__fetch_request`. Only a subagent may — because that is how an
# untrusted peer's request body is kept out of the long-lived main context. The
# per-capability tool limits are enforced separately, and more strongly, by each
# capability agent's own `tools:` frontmatter (a subagent cannot call a tool it
# was never given).
#
# Empirically verified (see experiments/): PreToolUse fires for MCP tools and
# can deny them; `agent_type` is present on the stdin payload inside a subagent
# and absent for the main agent.
#
# Register with a matcher for the fetch_request tool:
#
#   { "hooks": { "PreToolUse": [ {
#       "matcher": "mcp__escapement__fetch_request",
#       "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "/path/to/pretooluse-guard.sh" } ]
#   } ] } }
