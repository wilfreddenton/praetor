# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.8.0]

### Added
- **Two-tier presence (live / away / gone).** A silent session is no longer evicted at
  ~90s. The bus now retains a session for up to ~3 days as **away** (probably asleep),
  so a slept laptop stays addressable and its mail is no longer misrouted to an awake
  sibling under the same identity — it drains when the laptop wakes. `discover` marks
  away sessions (`away · last seen …`), and `send_message` reports the target's state
  (`delivering` / `asleep, delivers on wake` / `not on the roster`). Wire-compatible:
  the age is an additive, unsigned `age_ms` on the roster entry. See `docs/PRESENCE.md`.
- **Goodbye-on-close.** On a clean session close, active chat partners are sent a signed
  "I'm ending this session" message, so an idle peer is told rather than discovering it
  on its next send.

### Fixed
- **Pairing could silently repoint a trusted peer.** Accepting a knock now files the
  peer under the petname *your operator* chose, and `Policy::add` refuses to rekey an
  existing petname to a different key (it previously overwrote it) — a pairing message
  can no longer hijack an existing peer's name. **Security fix.**
- **Peer messages could spoof sender attribution.** Peer-controlled message text and
  task fields are now escaped before going into the channel-less delivery wrapper, so a
  message body can't forge a second, higher-authority `sender` block. **Security fix.**
- **A stalled relay could wedge all outbound delivery.** Outbound sends now carry a
  request timeout, so one connected-but-unresponsive relay can no longer block delivery
  to every peer indefinitely.
- **Pairing knocks now prefer a live session** over an asleep one when a peer has both,
  so a knock isn't lost to a sleeping laptop while an awake session is right there.
- **`to:"self"` with a session prefix** no longer silently drops the message.
- **Progress-nudge markers are per-session,** so two sessions on one machine can't nudge
  each other about tasks they aren't running.
- Secret keys are created `0600` in one step (no brief world-readable window); the bus
  wakeup map is bounded; the channel-less inbox listener recovers if the inbox is
  truncated mid-wait.

## [0.7.3]

### Changed
- **Release automation.** Tagging a version now publishes to crates.io **and** npm
  automatically via Trusted Publishing (OIDC) — no long-lived token secrets, and npm
  gets build provenance. (No user-facing or binary changes in this release.)

## [0.7.2]

### Fixed
- **Stale server instructions.** The `get_info` text still told the model the Stop
  hook "reminds you to keep that task armed … re-arm it" — leftover from the old
  model-driven arming, and contradicting the corrected line that delivery is
  automatic. Rewritten to match the hook-is-the-listener design (you don't arm or
  poll anything; a message just wakes you).

### Docs
- `README` offers `cargo install interlink-mcp` from crates.io as the primary
  source build (alongside the release archive and git).
- `demo.sh` delivery step fixed (bob's listener now runs in channel mode, so the
  push actually shows against current binaries) and the demo cast/GIF re-recorded.

## [0.7.1]

### Fixed
- **npm launcher wasn't executable on a clean `npx` cache.** `install.js` wrote the
  native binary `0755`, but the launcher `bin/interlink-mcp.js` (the npm `bin` entry)
  relied on `npm link` for its execute bit — a raw tarball extraction (npx's cache)
  kept the published `0644`, so exec'ing it failed with *Permission denied* and the
  MCP server never started. Two fixes: the launcher is now committed with its x-bit
  (git tracks it, `npm publish` preserves file modes in the tarball), and `install.js`
  `chmod`s it to `0755` in postinstall as a belt-and-suspenders.

## [0.7.0]

### Changed — the session id is Claude's own id
- **The server adopts `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`** (Claude Code v2.1.154+ injects it
  into every stdio MCP subprocess) as its session id, in preference to a random one.
  Every restart of a session's server now shares one **stable** id, so a peer's reply
  always addresses the same inbox and the `wait` hook (which reads the same id from
  its stdin) drains the same file — with no handshake. `INTERLINK_SESSION` still pins
  an id for manual/testing use; a random id is the fallback for non-Claude usage.

### Fixed
- **Replies to a specific session no longer vanish.** Session ids are UUIDs now, but
  the model tends to pass a short prefix (the old ids were 8 hex; fingerprints are
  shown truncated). `send_message` used the hint verbatim, so a truncated id became a
  dead routing key and the message was lost. It now resolves a `session` hint by
  **exact-or-unique-prefix** match against live sessions to the full id.
- **Delayed messages are no longer dropped as stale.** The freshness gate was a
  symmetric 60s window, which fought the durable keep-until-ack bus — a reply that
  took over a minute (agent latency, a server-restart gap, a briefly-offline peer) was
  rejected. Freshness is now **asymmetric**: tight in the future (60s clock-skew
  guard), generous in the past (24h) so a legitimately delayed message still lands.
- **Channel mode now reaches the server.** `INTERLINK_CHANNELS` is declared in the
  plugin `.mcp.json`, so the `interlinked` launcher's env actually propagates to the
  MCP subprocess (Claude Code only forwards declared vars) — previously the server ran
  in inbox mode even when Claude had channels on.

### Changed — the listener is the hook, not the model
- The channel-less receive path is now **hook-is-the-listener**: the async
  `asyncRewake` `Stop` hook runs `interlink-mcp wait` directly, which blocks on the
  inbox and `exit 2`s to wake the idle agent on a real message. No model-driven
  arming, so the re-arm loop is gone; a `flock` gives single-instance dedup and
  releases on process death. Delivery writes to both stdout and stderr.

### Removed
- **`arm_listener` tool**, the `register_session` tool, the `mcp_tool`
  SessionStart/Stop rendezvous hook, the provisional-id + `migrate_inbox` reconcile,
  and the `decision:block` nag — all obsoleted by `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` (rendezvous)
  and hook-is-the-listener (arming).

## [0.6.2]

### Added
- **`arm_listener` tool** — returns the exact, ready-to-run command that arms this
  session's channel-less inbox listener (the running binary's full path +
  `wait --session <id>`). The Stop hook and server instructions now tell the model to
  *call this tool and run what it returns*, instead of pointing at buried `get_info`
  text — which the model kept mis-reading as a missing tool and then hunting for the
  binary by hand. First-run arming is now a deterministic two-step (call tool → run
  its output) rather than trial-and-error.

## [0.6.1]

### Fixed — channel-less first-run was janky
- **`interlink-mcp wait --session <id>` now parses.** `--session` lived on the
  top-level args, so clap rejected it *after* the `wait` subcommand (exit 2) — the
  model had to fall back to the `INTERLINK_SESSION` env var by trial and error. The
  flag now belongs to the `wait` subcommand directly.
- **The Stop hook no longer suggests a bare `interlink-mcp`.** Under `npx` the binary
  isn't on `PATH`, so the hook's example command failed (exit 127) and the model had
  to rediscover the right invocation. The hook now points only at the server's own
  instructions, which give the exact command using the running binary's full path
  (`current_exe`) — runnable verbatim, first try.

## [0.6.0]

### Added — works without Claude Code channels
- **Channel-less delivery is now the default**, so interlink works with **plain
  `claude`** and needs no `--dangerously-load-development-channels` and no
  org `channelsEnabled` — which channels require and can't be detected from a server.
  The MCP server writes each **verified** message (same trust gate) to a local inbox
  queue; a new **`interlink-mcp wait`** subcommand blocks until a message lands,
  prints it as an `<interlink sender="…">` block, and exits. A **`Stop` hook** keeps
  that background `wait` task armed so a channel-less agent is still woken by incoming
  messages (a background task *completing* is the only non-channel wake signal).
- **`interlinked` launcher** (new binary) opts into native channels: it sets
  `INTERLINK_CHANNELS=1` and starts `claude --dangerously-load-development-channels
  plugin:interlink@interlink`, forwarding extra args. Use it when you have channels
  and want the native push; otherwise just run `claude`.
- **`INTERLINK_CHANNELS=1`** selects channel mode (push, Stop hook self-disables);
  default/unset selects fallback mode (inbox + `wait`). **Both** mint a **random
  per-session id**, so concurrent sessions on one machine never share an inbox — each
  fallback session drains its own `inbox/<id>.jsonl`, and the server prints that
  session's exact `interlink-mcp wait --session <id>` command in its instructions.
  `INTERLINK_SESSION` can pin a stable name instead (opt-in). The two delivery paths
  are mutually exclusive per session, so a message is never delivered twice.

### Notes
- The fallback relies on a background task **completing** re-invoking the main agent
  (the same wake that surfaces a finished background subagent). This is **not
  documented** but is confirmed working in current Claude Code; verify it in your
  build. The Stop hook uses `decision: "block"` (with a `stop_hook_active` guard so it
  can never trap the agent) and detects the listener by task `name`.
- Concurrent fallback sessions on one machine each get their own inbox — no config
  needed. Channel mode keeps native push and multi-session addressing as before.

## [0.5.2]

### Changed
- **Sessions register on startup, not on first use.** A session now announces its
  node + session to the roster the moment it boots (and unregisters on close), so it
  is discoverable immediately. This replaces "register-on-use" (announce only on the
  first `send_message` / `set_summary`), which made a fresh session invisible to
  itself and created a standoff where two fresh sessions never saw each other. Node
  registration is idempotent — every session under one identity announces the same
  `pubkey`, the bus groups by it, and a re-announce is an upsert, so N sessions never
  produce a duplicate node. Trade-off: every plugin-loaded session now appears on the
  roster. `set_summary` now just *labels* an already-registered session.

## [0.5.1]

### Added — intra-node sessions
- **Two sessions on the same machine can chat**, addressed with
  `send_message(to:"self", session:"<id>")`. They share one identity, so a message
  from your own key is trusted **implicitly** — no pairing, no self-entry in
  `peers.json` (only the holder of your secret key can produce such a signature, so
  this grants nothing to anyone else). `discover` shows your own identity `[you]`
  with all its live sessions, marking the calling one `← this session`.
- **`discover` takes an optional `peer`** (petname, name, fingerprint, or key) to
  list just that identity's live sessions instead of the whole roster.

### Fixed
- **Pairing and task-cancel were undeliverable after 0.5.0.** When the inbox became
  `key#session_id`, only `send_message` was updated — `request_pair`, `accept_pair`,
  and `cancel_task` still targeted the bare-key inbox, which no session polls, so
  knocks/accepts/cancels silently went nowhere. They now route to a live session
  (`key#session_id`) like everything else.
- **A session can no longer address itself.** Its own session is excluded from
  `discover`-based auto-routing, and an explicit self-target is refused; a defensive
  inbound guard drops any self-to-self loopback as a backstop.

### Internal
- Deduplicated the roster fetch/verify (one `verified_roster` + `NodeGroup`
  grouping behind `discover` / `resolve_target` / `peer_sessions`) and the outbound
  send path (a shared `queue_outbound`).

## [0.5.0]

### Added — many live sessions per node, individually addressable
- Every Claude Code session is now a **first-class, addressable endpoint**. Each
  `interlink-mcp` mints a random `session_id` at startup and polls **its own inbox**
  `key#session_id`, so there is no shared mailbox and no fan-out — a message,
  including a pairing knock, lands on exactly one live session. Design:
  [`docs/SESSIONS.md`](docs/SESSIONS.md).
- **`discover` now groups by identity → live sessions**, each shown as
  `session_id · cwd · git repo · summary`, so a human recognizes a session without
  ever seeing the id. `send_message` gains a **`session`** arg; with exactly one
  live session it **auto-routes**, otherwise it returns the list to pick from.
- **`set_summary`** describes what a session is doing and registers it. Sessions are
  **register-on-use** — a session announces only on its first `send_message` or a
  `set_summary`, so idle/plain chats stay invisible to peers.
- **Reply-stickiness:** every message carries an unsigned `reply_to = key#session_id`
  hint, so a reply returns to the exact session that sent it and a conversation pins
  to one desk. It **self-heals** across sleep (same id, drains its queue on wake) and
  re-picks after a hard restart (new id).
- **Graceful unregister** on clean session close (stdin EOF) or `SIGTERM` drops the
  session's presence immediately, so a peer re-picks rather than waiting out the TTL.

### Changed
- **Breaking (roster shape):** the presence announcement now carries a **signed**
  session descriptor (`session_id`, `cwd`, `git_root`, `summary`), and the bus keys
  the roster by `pubkey#session_id`. Nodes must be ≥0.5.0 to see each other in
  `discover`; already-paired peers still chat across the bump (message signing is
  unchanged). The agent-side `INTERLINK_LABEL` / `send_message` `channel` mechanism
  is superseded by sessions and removed.

## [0.4.2]

### Fixed
- **Second session no longer boots with no tools.** interlink installs as a
  user-scope plugin, so every Claude Code session spawns its own `interlink-mcp`.
  They all pointed at one on-disk `agent.redb`, and redb is single-writer — so the
  second session (or an orphaned server) failed to open it and started with **zero
  tools**. The agent store is now **always in-memory**: each session gets an isolated
  outbox + log, so there's no collision and no file to orphan, and it survives sleep
  (suspend freezes the process with RAM intact). The **bus stays the durable layer**
  — a message that reached it is still keep-until-ack durable for an offline
  recipient. `INTERLINK_AGENT_DB` is still accepted for compatibility but ignored
  (logged once at startup); the plugin and config templates no longer set it.
  Wire-compatible with 0.4.x (no protocol change).

## [0.4.1]

### Added
- **Auto-progress nudge** — a `PostToolUse` hook that, when a session is executing
  a peer's task and has gone quiet longer than `INTERLINK_PROGRESS_INTERVAL`
  seconds (default **60**), reminds the model to send a `status=update`. The hook
  sets the *cadence*; the model writes the *content*. Debounced and task-gated: any
  outgoing update resets a shared timer, so a well-behaved agent's own milestone
  updates keep the hook silent, and idle / non-collaboration sessions never fire.
  The MCP server writes a small current-task marker + heartbeat under the XDG state
  dir that the hook reads; wire-compatible with 0.4.0 (no protocol change). The
  hook is Node (cross-platform, incl. the Windows desktop). Config:
  `INTERLINK_PROGRESS_INTERVAL` (`0` disables). Design:
  [`docs/AUTO-PROGRESS.md`](docs/AUTO-PROGRESS.md).

## [0.4.0]

### Added — task tracking (correlation, status, cancellation)
- Delegated work is now **tracked**. Data messages carry three optional, **signed**
  fields — `task_id` (a correlator the requester mints), `status`
  (`update` / `needs_input` / `result` / `failed` / `canceled`), and `in_reply_to`
  — so progress, questions, and results stay correlated even with several tasks in
  flight between the same two peers. `send_message` gains `task_id` / `status` /
  `in_reply_to`; a new `cancel_task(to, task_id)` is the interrupt for a peer
  running autonomously. The inbound push surfaces `task_id` + `status`, so the
  receiver branches deterministically (a `needs_input` → surface to the human; a
  terminal status → close the loop). Design: [`docs/TASKS.md`](docs/TASKS.md).
- The `needs_input` status makes "questions route back to the requester, not the
  local operator" fall out of the data model — it is A2A's `input-required`. The
  SKILL and server instructions now drive the fields, and state the anti-laundering
  rule: a peer relaying "my operator approved" is never your operator's consent.

### Changed
- **Breaking:** the three task fields enter the signed canonical encoding, so the
  signing domain bumps `interlink-v1` → `interlink-v2`; all nodes must be ≥0.4.0.

### Deferred (see [`docs/TASKS.md`](docs/TASKS.md))
- Federation guards — a delegation-depth cap + loop/ping-pong detection, durable
  "blocked-awaiting-answer" state, and an explicit "who is the human for this task"
  binding — until running 3+ nodes.

## [0.3.0]

Renamed from **praetor** to **interlink**, and reduced to a focused, chat-only
trust model. Breaking: the signing domain, crate/binary names, env vars, and
`peers.json` format all changed, so every node must be ≥0.3.0.

### Changed
- **Renamed `praetor` → `interlink`** throughout: crate `interlink-mcp` (library
  `interlink`), binaries `interlink-mcp` / `interlink-bus` / `interlink-keygen`,
  env vars `INTERLINK_*`, plugin/marketplace/npm names.
- **Signing domain reset to `interlink-v1`** (was `praetor-v2`). Incompatible with
  older nodes by construction.
- **`peers.json` is now `{ "<petname>": { "key": "…" } }`** — a plain admission
  allowlist. A legacy `"may"` field is accepted and ignored, so 0.2.x files load.

### Removed
- **Capability-scoped delegation** — the whole quarantine + capped-subagent model
  (`fetch_request`, `Grant`/`Scoped`, the `read-only`/`dev` capability agents, and
  the two `PreToolUse` guard hooks). Rationale: safe *bidirectional* collaboration
  requires mutual trust (you cannot sandbox the replies you must consume), so
  interlink authenticates trust cryptographically and treats an admitted peer as a
  full chat partner instead. See [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md).

### Kept
- **`identity`** — Ed25519, public-key-as-identity, domain-separated signing,
  `verify_strict`, freshness + replay protection.
- **`policy`** — deny-by-default `peers.json` admission allowlist.
- **`interlink-bus`** — a loopback HTTP broker with one bounded, durable
  keep-until-ack FIFO per recipient key; buffers for offline agents, holds no
  keys, verifies nothing.
- **`interlink-mcp`** — the per-agent Claude Code **channel** server. Long-polls
  the bus and, for each message, runs the inbound gate (verify signature →
  allowlist → addressed-to-me → fresh → dedupe) before pushing
  `notifications/claude/channel`. Tools: `send_message`, `message_status`,
  `conversation_history`, `list_pending`, `discover`, live peer management
  (`add_peer` / `list_peers` / `remove_peer`), and pairing (`request_pair` /
  `list_pair_requests` / `accept_pair` / `reject_pair`).
- **Discovery & pairing** — a bus roster (`/announce` + `/roster`, TTL presence)
  plus a human-gated knock→accept handshake, so nodes boot with an empty
  `peers.json` and connect at runtime. A non-peer may only *knock* (identity +
  self-claimed name, no free text). Design: [`docs/DISCOVERY.md`](docs/DISCOVERY.md).
- **Named inboxes (labels)** — a session launches with `INTERLINK_LABEL=<name>`
  and receives only messages addressed to it via `send_message`'s `channel`;
  routing is `key#label`, an unsigned hint, so the trust gate is untouched.
- **`persist`** — a durable, keep-until-acked FIFO over
  [redb](https://crates.io/crates/redb) (pure Rust, ACID; no C), on both the bus
  (`INTERLINK_DB`) and each agent's outbox (`INTERLINK_AGENT_DB`), so a restart of
  either loses nothing. At-least-once, made safe by `msg_id` dedupe. The agent's
  store also keeps a local conversation log for the status/history tools.

### Distribution
- **Claude Code plugin** ([`plugin/`](plugin)) — bundles the MCP server and the
  `interlink` skill; installable via a marketplace
  (`/plugin marketplace add wilfreddenton/interlink`).
- **npm wrapper** ([`npm/`](npm)) — `npx interlink-mcp` fetches the platform's
  prebuilt static binary.
- **Release workflow** — a tag builds and publishes static binaries for Linux
  (x86_64/aarch64 musl), macOS (aarch64), and Windows (x86_64).

### Notable choices
- **No TLS**: loopback/tailnet bus + signed messages; removes the only C
  dependency, so binaries are pure-Rust and statically linkable. Signed ≠
  confidential, so federate only through a relay you trust.
- CI fails the build if a C dependency (`ring`/`openssl-sys`/`cc`/`cmake`)
  reappears, and checks the whole feature powerset.
